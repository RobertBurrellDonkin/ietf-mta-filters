2.2.  :list match type for "address", "envelope", and "header" tests

   ABNF:

      MATCH-TYPE  =/ ":list"
           ; only valid for "address", "envelope", and "header" tests

   The new ":list" match type changes the interpretation of the "key-
   list" parameter to the "address"/"envelope"/"header" test.  When the
   match type is ":list", the key-list becomes a list of names of
   externally stored lists.  The external lists are queried, perhaps
   through a list-specific mechanism, and the test evaluates to "true"
   if any of the specified values matches any member of one or more of
   the lists.
