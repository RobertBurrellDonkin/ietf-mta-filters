Proposal: Allow Relative URLs

Use Cases: Local Lists

Relative URLs are a reasonable metaphor for resources private 
to the engine running the script. This allows:

1. the choice of storage protocol to be transparent to the user
2. scripts accessing local resources to be portable

The "/" metaphor is suggested for shared resources:

1. Shared Blacklist

Example:

 if list: "/blacklist" {
   reject;
 }

2. Shared Distribution List

 redirect list: "/staff"

Use Case Three: Private User Specific Lists 

 if list: "MyFriends" {
   keep;
 }

This is really just neat syntactic sugar.
