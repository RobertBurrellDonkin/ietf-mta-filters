2.3.  :list tagged argument to the "redirect" action

   Usage:  redirect :list <ext-list-name: string>

   The "redirect" action with the ":list" argument is used to send the
   message to one or more email addresses stored in the externally
   stored list 'ext-list-name'.  This variant of the redirect command
   can be used to implement a personal distribution list.

   Use of this feature requires that the list resolve to a list of email
   addresses, and that the Sieve engine be able to enumerate those
   addresses. [[anchor5: Alexey would like the option of allowing the
   list handler to enumerate the addresses and do the redirect there.
   Barry thinks that's contrary to Sieve, which expects to queue the
   redirect action for processing at a later stage, and that it would be
   a bad idea to have the redirect happen in the list handler.  The WG
   needs to resolve this issue.]]  In cases where, for example, a list
   contains hashed email address values or an email address pattern
   ("sz*@example.com", "*+ietf@example.net"), it will not be possible to
   redirect to that list.

   If the Sieve engine [[anchor6: or list handler?]] is permanently
   unable to enumerate the list or the list does not resolve to email
   addresses, the situation MUST result in a runtime error in the Sieve
   script.

   See Section 2.4 for the detailed description of syntax used for
   naming externally stored lists.

   The Sieve engine and external list server MUST collaborate to
   achieve a redirection semantically consistent with the definition
   of redirect in [Sieve]. If the Sieve engine and external list server 
   find themselves unable to perform this redirect then the situation 
   MUST result in a runtime error in the Sieve script.
